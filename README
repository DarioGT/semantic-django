Semantic-Django is a project to create an OSM (object semantic mapper).

Installation requirements are on file requirements.txt and can be installed using: pip install -r requirements.txt

Currently being developed a Django backend compatible with Virtuoso.

Next steps:
  - Create a generic field with a get_prep_lookup that add "optional" on sparql query when field's blanks is True
  - Implement and ALWAYS call a "add_default_where" of WhereNode (this method always will add all fields of model and get all properties of semantic database)
  - Improve DatabaseWrapper's operators to create a query using FILTERS (Ex: FILTER (?var = graph:Node)) of SPARQL
